          <h2>What is Expert Response?</h2>
          <p>
            Expert Response is a responsive web app designed to allow users to
            connect instantly with an expert virtually in any field. The app is
            designed for those who seek professional advice whether at work, at
            home, or on the go

          <p>
            Our users need a way to connect instantly with an expert in a
            specific field to help answer questions because they want to be more
            informed and prepared before they face the task or problem at hand.
          </p>
          <h2>Hypothesis Statement</h2>
          <p>
            By creating an expert-booking platform, we can enable curious
            learners to gain convenient access to professional guidance allowing
            them to be more informed and prepared.

            Seeking advice takes many forms. For some, it may be seeking out a
            professional. For others, it may be turning to family or friends.
            The lack of relative research required me to find a way to delve
            into the issue.

          <p>
            With having validated the problem statement and hypothesis through
            research, I created user flows, personas, and journeys to visualize
            and maintain a connection with the users.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the research collected and empathy built, they will act as an
            anchor throughout the design process to ensure the users needs are
            met.

          <h2>Ideate</h2>
          <p>
            After creating a visual of the users needs, it was time to start
            sketching out low-fidelity wireframes of Expert Response. This
            allowed me to rapidly explore different ideas and layouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I thought out and sketched many design layouts that would best fit
            the users needs and demands. I discovered many designs that would
            best fit for prototyping.
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source
              srcset="img/expert/expert_response-ideate@1x.jpg"
              media="(max-width:767px)"
            />

            />
          </picture>
          <h2>Prototype</h2>
          <p>
            Once the sketching was complete, I moved on to creating mid-fidelity
            wireframes with Figma. I realized early on that there were many
            features and factors that I did not previously account for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having completed the mid-fidelity wireframes, I developed them into
            a high-fidelity working prototype that will be ready for testing.
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source

            />
          </picture>
          <h2>Test</h2>
          <p>
            Equipped with a high-fidelity working prototype, I started to devise
            an evaluative research plan to test my design using both
            quantitative and qualitative methods.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was very rewarding seeing and observing Expert Response in
            action! I was pleased when features acted as planned, but I was very
            pleased to see features that did not.

          <h3>Usability Issues and Solutions</h3>
          <p>
            One of the scenario tasks was to locate an existing chat with a
            mechanic. I found that over half of the participants struggled
            locating the mechanic within their inbox.
          </p>
          <h3>1st Iteration</h3>
          <p>
            Originally, users would go into their inbox and see their existing
            chats with the intention that users would know the professions of
            each expert.
          </p>
          <h3>Issue 1</h3>
          <p>“I don’t know who everyone is that I’ve talked to”</p>
          <p>
            Almost all mentioned something similar when attempting the task. The
            participants attempted to guess the expert's profession based on
            their picture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before I could add the profession of each expert, I needed to
            rethink the layout. I went back to sketching low-fidelity wireframes
            to locate the best design. Once I determined the best design, I
            incorporated it into my existing high-fidelity prototype.
          </p>

              alt="Usability Issue 1"
            />
          </picture>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            I moved the date down and put the profession on the right side of
            the name in the inbox. For the chat, the profession went underneath
            the name.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Another issue found was the beginning of the onboarding process.
          </h3>
          <p>
            A few participants skipped the onboarding process, and a couple
            participants were confused about what the first page was.
          </p>
          <h3>Issue 2</h3>
          <p>
            This page confused almost half of the participants. They kept asking
            whether to press the “skip” or “explore” button.
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source

              alt="Usability Issue 2"
            />
          </picture>
          <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>
            To fix the confusion, I removed the skip button so users will have
            to use the “explore” button. However, on the next two pages, the
            skip button still exists.
          </p>
          <h3>Refined Design</h3>
          <p>
            In addition to the usability testing, Expert Response went through
            preference tests, emotional design strategies, peer feedback,
            accessibility guidelines, and mentor consultations.
